# second-mern
this is a beta software about Scrum Pocker to prepare myself for my test! 

#backend 
I will work with Visual Studio Code and the most import thing to get a good software It is the structure, how will we organize all our files.
So the structure goes:
--->second-mern
    |--->backend
         |--->src
             |--->controlles
             |--->models
             |--->routes
         |--->app.ks
         |--->database.js
         |--->index.js
